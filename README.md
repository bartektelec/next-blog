# JavaScript 2 Hackathon

> As a developer it is important to have side projects.

- it's a good way to impliment the technologies you are interested in
- it shows the world you are capable developer and are actively developing code
- it shows you have willingness to learn new things
- it helps you learn

For this hackathon you are to build a Personal website with a blog section.

It is time for you start writing about what you have learned about. Do not wait for one day to come. Start now. e.g write blog post about what an Array is and how you access an index of an array. This will help you verbalise and cemenet your understanding of JS, CSS and HTML.

This project will be long living you do not have to complete it all in one day.

## Requirements

- you may build it in Vanilla JS (using what you know today) or 
- you may use a JS Framework (if you are comfortabloe with one e.g React JS)
- get something on screen as fast as possible do not focus on the graphic design, use a CSS Framework and if you site looks like the framework in the beginning this is fine. You can update the "Design" at a later stage.
